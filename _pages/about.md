Hey there! I’m Itay Nakash, a Research Scientist at IBM and an MSc Candidate in Data Science at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, working under the supervision of Prof. Roi Reichart.

At IBM, my research focuses on AI safety and security, with a particular emphasis on identifying vulnerabilities in AI systems and ensuring the safety of autonomous agents. At the Technion, I’m developing innovative techniques to adapt LLM vocabularies and create custom tokenizers, aimed at improving domain-specific performance in Large Language Models (LLMs).

Outside of my academic work, I’m an avid freediver (with a personal record of 3:40 minutes underwater), wave surfer, and hiker.

Feel free to connect if you'd like to discuss AI safety, security, or any exciting developments in tech!
